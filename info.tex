- performance test => non-functional software test => determine => stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of applications up under a given workload (1)   

- different stage of performance test (1)=> 
      - Software analysis and requirements preparation
      - Strategy design
      - Load generator configuration
      - Server and load generator monitoring
      - Test data generation
      - Load scripts development
      - Preliminary tests launch
      - Tests execution
      - Results analysis and reporting


- Performance Testing Life Cycle (PTLC) (2) => connection between the expected result and the actual result => output =>
    - responsive application with better performance.

- PTLC phases =>
    - Risk Assessment
    - Requirement Gathering & Analysis
    - Performance Test Planning
    - Performance Test Design (Scripting)
    - Workload Modelling 
    - Performance Test Execution & Result Analysis
    - Reporting and Recommendation

**********************Test types****************************

- Testing types (3) => 
    - Load testing =>
    - Stress testing =>
    - Soak testing => 
    - Spike testing => 
    - Breakpoint testing =>
    - Configuration testing => 
    - Isolation testing =>
    - Internet testing
