- performance test => non-functional software test => determine => stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness (SSSR) of applications up under a given workload (1). 

- performance test (4) => software testing process => speed, response time, stability, reliability, scalability, and resource usage of a software application under a particular workload => main aspects => speed, scalability, and stability (SSS) 

- different stage of performance test (1)=> 
      - Software analysis and requirements preparation
      - Strategy design
      - Load generator configuration
      - Server and load generator monitoring
      - Test data generation
      - Load scripts development
      - Preliminary tests launch
      - Tests execution
      - Results analysis and reporting


- Performance Testing Life Cycle (PTLC) (2) => connection between the expected result and the actual result => output =>
    - responsive application with better performance.

- PTLC phases =>
    - Risk Assessment
    - Requirement Gathering & Analysis
    - Performance Test Planning
    - Performance Test Design (Scripting)
    - Workload Modelling 
    - Performance Test Execution & Result Analysis
    - Reporting and Recommendation

**********************Test types****************************

- Testing types (3) => (LSSSBCII) =>
    - Load testing => simplest format of performance test =>
        - monitoring application behavior under specified expected loading condition 
    - Stress testing => to determine the maximum capacity (efficient performance) of system (application) above the expected maximum load 
    - Soak (endurance testing) testing => to determine of sustained performance of system (application) after   continuous expected load
    - Spike testing => Monitoring system (application ) manner according to modification load based on suddenly increase or decrease number of users
    - Breakpoint (Capacity) testing  => similar to stress testing => according to predetermined failure condition, to determine the maximum capacity (efficient performance) of system (application)  based on incremental load over the time 
    - Configuration testing => to determine the effects of configuration changes to the system's components on the system's performance and behavior
    - Isolation testing => involving repetitive test execution that resulted in a system problem to determine and confirm  the fault domain
    - Internet testing => 



    - Testing types (4) => (LSE(S)SVS) =>
        - Load testing 
        - Stress testing 
        - Endurance testing  
        - Spike testing
        - Volume testing => (?????????)
        - Scalability testing => to determine the software application's effectiveness in “scaling up” to support an increase in user load 


***************************Common Performance Problems**********************************

Common Performance Problems (4) =>
    - Long Load time
    - Poor response time
    - Poor scalability 
    - Bottlenecking 



 ***********************************SDLC************************************************

- SDLC phases (5)=>
    - Requirement analysis
    - Planning
    - Software design such as architectural design
    - Software development
    - Testing
    - Deployment

************************************ Automation test**************************************
- Automation test procedure (6)=>
    - Defining test requirements.
    - Building a test environment.
    - Managing tests and data points.
    - Utilizing the results to drive key decisions in the SDLC process.
